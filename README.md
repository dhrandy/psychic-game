# Psychic Game Homework 3

## Description

This is a build project for my coding bootcamp class. I had to build a working game using JavaScript as part of my homework assignment. I chose to build the Psychic game.

## Instructions

1. Enter your name in the popup.
2. Select a letter.
3. Click the reset button to reset the scores.

The point of the game is to try to guess what letter the computer has chosen. You have 10 guesses. If you guess correctly, you win and 1 is added to the Win. If you don't guess withing 10 guesses, you lose and 1 gets added to the losses.
